## 🌟 **Key Features**

- **Simple Neural Network Architecture**: 
  - Built with **two hidden layers** and an output layer to classify digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. 🖥️➡️🔢

- **MNIST Dataset**:
  - The classic **handwritten digit dataset**, perfect for learning how neural networks handle image data. 📝🖋️

- **Customizable Data Loaders**:
  - Split data into **training**, **validation**, and **test** sets for better model evaluation. 📊

- **Model Evaluation & Accuracy Calculation**:
  - Track and visualize your model’s **performance** during training and validate it on unseen data. 📈👀

- **PyTorch Framework**:
  - **PyTorch** is the backbone of this project, giving us the flexibility and simplicity to build and train deep learning models. ⚙️💻

- **Softmax Activation**:
  - Use **Softmax** for converting the network output into probabilities that sum up to 1, ensuring accurate classification. 💯

## 💻 **How It Works**

Here’s how this project comes together, step by step: 🛠️

1. **Dataset Preprocessing** 📥:
   - We load the **MNIST dataset** and apply transformations (e.g., converting images to tensors). 
   - The dataset is **split** into **training**, **validation**, and **test** sets to ensure proper evaluation.

2. **Neural Network Design** 🧑‍💻:
   - **Input Layer**: The network receives **28x28 pixel images** (784 features).
   - **Hidden Layers**: Two fully connected hidden layers with **ReLU activations**.
   - **Output Layer**: A final softmax output layer, with 10 units (one for each digit). 🔢

3. **Training** ⚡:
   - We use **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** with a learning rate of 0.01.
   - The **Cross-Entropy loss function** is used to measure how close the model's predictions are to the true labels.

4. **Evaluation** 📊:
   - The model’s performance is evaluated on a **validation set** during training.
   - After training, we test the model on the **test set** to calculate accuracy and final performance. ✅
